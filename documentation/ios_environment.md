# SensMove iOS App

For a better asynchronous handler, when receiving data from bluetooth or when processing user service data we are using reactive cocoa library.

To manage packages Objective-C we are using cocoapod, for swift packages we simply drag & drop the library into the project library folder.

Actually, user services are stored in a local json file "SMData.json" but later there will be a web service.

## UI

Please use Autolayout for the UI.

## Notes

Left insole data and accelerometer data are not processed. Take a look at the graphic mockup for a better understanding of the final design in design/app_exports folder.
