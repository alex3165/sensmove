# iOS App

For a better asynchronous handler, when receiving datas from bluetooth or handle user service we are using reactive cocoa library.

To manage packages Objective-C we are using cocoapod, for swift package we are simply drag & drop the library into the project library folder.

Actually, user services are localy and the datas are stored in json file "SMData.json" but later there will be a web service.
