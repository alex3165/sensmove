Sensmove is the first open-sourced smart insole system that allows the user to visualize his foot forces simultaneously on his smartphone.

The smart insole get 7 force sensitive resistor sensors distributed along it. The datas are sent through bluetooth to the mobile phone.


## Possibles uses cases

- Sport: Help sportsmen in their trainning by coaching them trough an application and check that the person performs his exercises correctly. Check your strides.
- Music: Use it as a loop pedal or metronome.
- Robotic: Stabilize balance of a robot.
- Medical: Help podolog to design better insole, help kinesitherapist to follow their patients during their consultation.


## Technologies

- Arduino environment for insole electronic system.
- IOS environment for mobile application development.


## Improvements

Lots of improvements should be done, it is a first draft of the possibilities of the insole, the final purpose is to provide as usable as possible smart insole system.

Improvements should be done on mobile application and on hardware, if you want to improve it, you can check github issues for details.


## Documentation

All the documentation can be found in documentation folder.
