The Embedded version lets you create custom types, taxonomy and fields for your theme or plugin, without requiring any plugin.

= Instructions =

1. Create the directory called 'embedded-types' in the root folder of your theme or plugin.

2. Copy the entire content of this directory (embedded) to the 'embedded-types' that you just created.

3. Include them from the themeâ€™s functions.php file by adding these statements at the very beginning (right after the php statement):

require_once dirname(__FILE__) . '/embedded-types/types.php';

4. Export your configuration from your development site. Go to the Types->Import/Export menu and click on the 'Export' button. You will receive a ZIP file with the XML and PHP configuration files (both are required).

Unzip that file and place both settings.xml and the setting.php into the embedded-types directory.


You're done!
